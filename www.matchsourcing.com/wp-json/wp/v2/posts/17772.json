So, if you are a novice, without any knowledge of these terms, then this blog will give you an insight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A forwarding agency is basically an agency that takes the role of importers and exporters and tries to ensure the safe and seamless transportation of products and goods. Basically, forwarding agencies are experts at your service to ensure that the goods reach their destination in the best possible manner.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shipping agents are also similar, but they are slightly restrictive when it comes to transportation, services provided, and facilities. Shipping agencies are responsible for managing and handling the cargo and shipments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can always contact a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/shipping\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">China forwarding service<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> agent that can get you in touch with reliable shipping and forwarding agencies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freight Forwarding Agent Meaning<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17773\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Forwarding-and-transportation.png\" alt=\"Forwarding-and-transportation\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Forwarding-and-transportation.png 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Forwarding-and-transportation-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freepik.com\/free-photo\/truck-driver-inspecting-truck-long-vehicle-before-driving_11450972.htm#page=1&amp;query=shipping%20and%20forwarding&amp;position=12&amp;from_view=search\" target=\"_blank\"  rel=\"nofollow\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freepik<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A freight forwarding agent is someone who takes care of the transportation of goods or people from one point to another. It is important to note that the freight forwarding agent is only responsible to arrange for the transportation of goods. The agent arranges the services for movement but does not actually move the goods.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A forwarding agent is also a part of the Technology Sales Leads (TSL) industry and provides a great variety of services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is solely the responsibility of the freight forwarding agent to make sure that not just the transportation, but packaging which includes special accommodation for delicate products is done appropriately.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Services Provided By A Freight Forwarding Agent<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17774 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Services.png\" alt=\"Services\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Services.png 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Services-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freepik.com\/free-vector\/parcel-delivery-stages-set_4283970.htm#page=1&amp;query=services%20for%20shipping&amp;position=13&amp;from_view=search\" target=\"_blank\"  rel=\"nofollow\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freepik<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a number of services provided by a freight forwarding agent. As mentioned above, transportation is not the only duty that comes under forwarding agent services. It ranges from packaging to insurance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>1. Planning<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First and foremost, planning. This will definitely need to be up to the mark.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be followed by packaging, proper storage along with special arrangements for products that can be damaged when exposed to the environment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>2. Warehousing<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warehousing is extremely significant, for that matter. Proper warehouse of their own or making the requisite arrangements for the same also comes under the set of duties of freight forwarders.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>3. Labeling<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freight forwarding agents ensure that the labeling is done flawlessly. This step is crucial so that the information about weight and other details are clearly visible. This will be a great help in the organization and there will be minimal to zero chances of any mistake in delivery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, freight forwarding agents ensure that the goods are handled with extreme care to avoid any damage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>4. Paperwork<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freight forwarding agents have to deal with paperwork. Properly handling the paperwork will ensure that the documentation is completed in a jiffy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freight forwarding agents, being experts in their jobs, know the dos and don\u2019ts of shipment, and can help one fetch the best insurance. Looking after the cargo insurance\/filing insurance is the main task for the freight forwarding agents.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>5. Source of Transportation<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For freight forwarding agencies, if there is distant transportation, choosing the best-fitted source is one of the topmost priorities. Making the bookings of the cargo space at the earliest, finding the cheapest yet a good source, has to be done very attentively because if the transportation is not arranged properly, there is no point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>6. Freight Consolidation<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freight consolidation is another errand for the agents. Their proficiency in this regard will lead to a significant cost advantage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clearing and Forwarding Process<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17775 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Processes.png\" alt=\"Processes\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Processes.png 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Processes-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freepik.com\/free-vector\/delivery-logistics-shipment-set-four-isometric-images-with-colourful-icons-pictograms-human-characters-cars-illustration_6869953.htm#page=1&amp;query=shipping%20process&amp;position=7&amp;from_view=search#position=7&amp;page=1&amp;query=shipping%20process\" target=\"_blank\"  rel=\"nofollow\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freepik<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to understand the concept of clearing and forwarding if you are in the field of business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The clearing and forwarding process basically ensures the trouble-free shipment of goods to their destination. Both clearing and forwarding agents have to work at different stages of the process to accomplish their duties. It is very rare that both of them are the same person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s take a look at these processes quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Clearing Process<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The clearing process is the one where clearing agents look after smooth shipment of the goods in regards to legal matters. Negotiating with local authorities and custom inspection work smoothly under clearing agents. Clearing agents are also called custom brokers and custom house agents.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evidently, the role of the clearing agent is very crucial in exporting goods. They are supposed to have all the knowledge about custom facilities and local laws.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dealing within the custom authorities requires a good level of organization and communication skills, clearing agent suffices the role.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adding to that, clearing agents also help in avoiding demurrage charges. When shipment overstays their welcome on the terminal, they are required to pay a large amount of demurrage charge. Clearing agents can become a savior then and can circumvent it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Forwarding Process<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The forwarding processor freight forwarding process is the one where freight forwarder agents guarantee the smooth shipment of the goods from the manufacturer to the warehouse.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freight forwarders take over the job of shipping the goods from the manufacturer itself.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from that, they look after packaging, documentation, insurance, transportation methods and routes, warehouse, leveling, booking cargo, and freight consolidation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freight forwarding agents are basically the guardians of the goods till it reaches the warehouse, and clearing agents come into play when the shipments go for inspection during the final minutes of export.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freight Forwarding Companies in China<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17776\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Companies-and-processes.png\" alt=\"Companies and processes\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Companies-and-processes.png 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Companies-and-processes-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freepik.com\/free-vector\/order-worldwide-delivery-service-storehouse-products-storage-transit-warehouse-bonded-warehouse-transferring-process-goods-concept-pinkish-coral-bluevector-isolated-illustration_11667358.htm#page=1&amp;query=shipping%20process&amp;position=19&amp;from_view=search\" target=\"_blank\"  rel=\"nofollow\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freepik<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below are a few of the reputed freight forwarding companies in China.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>1.
