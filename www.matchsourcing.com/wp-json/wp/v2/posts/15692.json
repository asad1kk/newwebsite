Chinese products are everywhere, you cannot miss a product or two in your house without the &#8220;made in China&#8221; tag. That means that selling Chinese products is an ideal business. Importing business products from China is one of the ways to maximize your profits.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process of importing goods is not as simple as it may seem, there are a lot of things involved. You need to know <a href=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/how-to-find-suppliers\">how and where to find the best suppliers<\/a>, how to communicate and negotiate with the manufacturers, and the process of shipping.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This article will guide you on the steps, popular goods, and precautions that should be taken during the process of importing from China.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Why Should You Import Goods From China?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-15695 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Importing-From-China.jpg\" alt=\"Importing From China\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Importing-From-China.jpg 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Importing-From-China-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Source: Pinterest<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">China is well known as the &#8221; world factory&#8221; because of its massive production of goods. There are a lot of manufacturers and suppliers in this region. Let us look at some of the reasons you should consider sourcing goods from China and not any other place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Chinese products offer high-profit margins<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Chinese manufacturers sell their products at very cheap and affordable prices. The profit margin of goods imported from China is up to 100-1000%. Meaning you can get your money back up to 10 times after reselling those products. Setting selling prices for products imported from China is very simple because there are no chances of making losses.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Chinese Products are of good quality.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Customers will always look for products that are of good quality because they value their money. Many people mistake the cheap price for poor quality products. Sourcing from China is an assurance of good quality products at an affordable price. Before the products are shipped, they must go through inspection. The process of importing will not continue if the goods are not of the required standard.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Goods From China are very unique. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chinese<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">manufacturers are very innovative and creative as well. They come up with products that cannot be found in other parts of the world. Nothing sells so well like unique products that are of good quality. The more you sell products, the higher the profits and the more your business grows. Many countries have high market demand but they have very few manufacturers to meet those specific demands. China steps in to fill those gaps with its massive production of unique products.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>China offers you the freedom to choose desirable factories<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. When working with local suppliers, there is no liberty to go through their terms and conditions. Most of these suppliers will only need you to give a description of the products you need, and they confirm whether they can meet your expectations or not. <\/span>This is not the case in Chinese manufacturers. You have the freedom to visit the factory in person and see their working conditions. That makes it easy to source your products directly from them. You will select the desired products and the respective factories. Sourcing goods from China will help your business to achieve the desired success and make customers happy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What Are The Popular Products Imported From China?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, there is no country that can match China&#8217;s production level. The Chinese manufacturers are able to produce massive goods because they have cheap manual labor, a lot of skilled labor, strong government support, a good capital base, enough rare earth metal reserves and they also have a good supply chain ecosystem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0It is important to shortlist the products you are interested in and the suppliers. Many people prefer using <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/\"><b>a Chinese sourcing agent<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to inquire, get in contact with the best suppliers and get your products shipped safely. The products that you intend to import should be of high demand, simple, convenient to use, affordable, profitable, and have high sale frequency.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Confirm whether the products you intend to import are allowed in your country. Some products like tobacco, alcohol and some medicine are banned in many countries. The following are some of the categories of common and profitable goods that you can import.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Clothing<\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-15697 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Different-Clothing.jpg\" alt=\"Different Clothing\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Different-Clothing.jpg 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Different-Clothing-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Source: Pinterest<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different Chinese manufacturers make various types of clothes, for example, dresses, skirts, sweaters, jeans, swimwear, jeans, sportswear, jackets, shirts, t-shirts, shorts, pants, socks, and even caps.

Products from China are considered by most customers and retailers since the quality is not compromised. You might be asking yourself how you will start the whole process of<\/span><b> sourcing from China<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at some point. Before everything, let us have a look at a few factors to put into consideration before sourcing from China.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>1. Look For The Right Supplier<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-15705 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Umbrella-supplier-in-China.jpg\" alt=\"Umbrella supplier in China\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Umbrella-supplier-in-China.jpg 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Umbrella-supplier-in-China-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Source: Pinterest<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/product-sourcing-services\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">seeking to import products from China<\/span><\/a><\/span> use the internet search buttons as their default option. You can as well visit online sourcing platforms such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.made-in-china.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"  rel=\"nofollow\" ><b>Made in China<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which gives buyers suggestions of suppliers in China. It is always advised to identify a manufacturer and directly source from them since this will help you to reduce costs. Consider the following factors when looking for the right supplier<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Background Information. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most companies have their own website where you can access their background information including status on their registration, where they operate from, business coverage, and many more. If you don&#8217;t come across the word \u201cproduction\u201d in registered business coverage, then the supplier you are working with might be a trader and not a factory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Manufacturer Certification.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A Production certificate is a good sign of both the capability of the supplier and industry knowledge. To own a manufacturer certificate means your factory is tested and verified to produce reliable products.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Export experience.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Experienced suppliers know everything about the export process and the safety or compliance regulations involved in the sales market. Ask your supplier about the export process to your state, you can alternatively ask the supplier to provide you with the shipping B\/L from the past shipment for verification.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Location.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Always consider the distance from your supplier to the seaport or the airport. The shorter the distance the lower the pre-carriage transport cost to your shipment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Request For A Samples<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-15706 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/A-sample-product.jpg\" alt=\"A sample product\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/A-sample-product.jpg 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/A-sample-product-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Source: Pinterest<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of suppliers prefer the use of minimum order quantities. This means a supplier will only allow orders from a certain limit say the minimum order is 500 units so that buyers will not take advantage of wholesale prices for small orders.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternatively, the supplier knows that some of the clients or retailers may want to see and feel the product physically before making an order of thousands of products. Inquire from the supplier to give you a sample product. Most of the suppliers will have to sell you a sample of the product you want to purchase at the retail price.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case the supplier you have identified offers any custom or private labeling on your products, for example including your logo or other unique designs, having to order a sample is very important. Having seen and felt a product will help you know whether it is ideal for your business and whether you prefer to invest heavily in the product.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. Consider Quality Over Cost<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-15708 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Quality-production.jpg\" alt=\"Quality production\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Quality-production.jpg 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Quality-production-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Source: Pinterest<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the purchasers globally look at suppliers in China and ask for their requirements. One of the main reasons is low manufacturing costs, which even after the add-ons of shipping charges and import duties it still ends up being cheaper for the purchaser than<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">importing the product<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">from elsewhere in the West. During the negotiation process with the suppliers, it is important to know that all suppliers have the minimum cost it takes to manufacture the product.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case you have done your research concerning the product, the costs incurred on raw material and market, it will be easy to determine the price. Also, do not go for suppliers who will provide you with a lower price than the cost incurred for the whole production process. Secondly, the ideal purchasers for example those who buy products in bulk from the viewpoint of the supplier may attempt to beat down their chosen supplier\u2019s price even further.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember when suppliers set their prices below their minimum price limit, definitely it will have an effect somewhere else. It could lead to either a reduction in the quality of raw material or have an effect on workers&#8217; wages or even affect the conditions of work. It could also lead to the supplier not following the recommended steps in the quality control process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mostly when packaging consumer products, you prefer using high-quality materials. Nobody wants to purchase premium products like cosmetics with cheap packaging. In the long run, all these effects will not only be felt in the finished product but will also downgrade your reputation and could even have legal implications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>4. Negotiate With The Suppliers<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-15709 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Supplier-negotiation.jpg\" alt=\"Supplier negotiation\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Supplier-negotiation.jpg 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Supplier-negotiation-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Source: Pinterest<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case you make orders for large volumes of products, manufacturers will be able to earn more money since they normally offer low prices. So the more their products are purchased in bulk, the more they will earn more profits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, you as a retailer have to show your manufacturer the idea that you are planning to have a big start. The moment you are done finding a reliable manufacturer, you can send them a message requesting them to offer you the best prices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It will be ideal to have your order placed for around 50 or more units at the beginning of your business. When you order a few products, say one or two products will give your supplier the impression that you don\u2019t have enough capital to invest with them and for that matter, they might not make more money having you as their retailer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>5.
