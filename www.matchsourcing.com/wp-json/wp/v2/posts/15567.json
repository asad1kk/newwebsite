The more items you purchase, the lesser each unit will cost you, as a general rule of thumb. So, try striking a balance between staying within your budget and not buying such a small amount.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Quality Standards &amp; Reports<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hiring a quality inspector ensures that the quality of your products is good. Make sure that the accessories are according to set standards. Do not forget to inspect for packaging &amp; physical requirements, functional tests, visual inspection, and barcode verification.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Custom Design<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nowadays, customers like having phone cases, covers, and holders in custom-made designs, so you should consider their preferences. For this, you may provide a design specification sheet to the manufacturer or supplier. If you\u2019ve ordered custom designs for phone accessories, make sure they are according to the specification sheet. In case the strategies are complex, ask for a product sample beforehand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Pricing &amp; Payment<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When importing products from China, there are several ways to pay, including PayPal, wire transfer\/Telegraphic Transfer (TT), and Letter of Credit (LOC).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For pricing information, you should ask the manufacturer for the cost breakdown (cost of the item, shipping, taxes, tariff). You should know how much the item actually costs and how much you are paying additionally. Also, decide on the current and future payment terms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Lead Time<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No merchant wants his product not to be replenished in time during a sales upswing. When choosing a phone accessories supplier, considering the lead time is very important. If you are purchasing in bulk, it is essential to know precisely how long production takes and what affects the lead time. You can also work with a sourcing company in China to help with the production follow-up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Shipping<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While some businesses ship internationally, others are content with just servicing their domestic markets. When finalizing vendor sourcing in China to purchase mobile phone accessories, know whether they ship internationally. International shipping procedures are far more complex than local shipments, so you must consider several factors to ensure seamless delivery. These factors play a crucial role in determining how long the shipping will take.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some mediums of transport such as sea, air, or rail are the most commonly used shipping services. But before opting for either, consider the time, cost, and nature of your imported products. While air freight is faster than ocean shipping, it is more expensive. Sea freight, on the other hand, is affordable but takes a long time. It is also not suitable for shipping delicate items that cannot endure extended trips in enclosed containers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It would be best to consider individual countries\u2019 restrictions to ensure that you don\u2019t breach their guidelines and adhere to the prescribed international shipping address formats.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Customs Duties &amp; Documents<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-15586 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Calculating-Hard-Cash.jpg\" alt=\"Calculating Hard Cash\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Calculating-Hard-Cash.jpg 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Calculating-Hard-Cash-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Source: Unsplash<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When shipping from one country to another, you must follow the custom guidelines.
