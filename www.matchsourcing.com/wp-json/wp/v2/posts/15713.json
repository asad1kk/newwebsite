The advantage of using a drop-ship for a retailer is that you don&#8217;t have to own a warehouse to store your products. It is also advantageous to the client since ships are faster and affordable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0This is how it works: A client makes an order to the retailer then the retailer forwards the order and clients details to a dropship supplier from this point, a drop-ship distributor processes the order, packages it on behalf of the retailer then ships it directly to the client.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Wholesale Clothing<\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-15738 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/wholesale-clothing.jpg\" alt=\" wholesale clothing\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/wholesale-clothing.jpg 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/wholesale-clothing-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Source: Pinterest<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is another mode that is preferred by most clothing businesses.
