He succeeded in promoting and marketing his own brand in the U.S.. 6 months ago, a terrible story turned out to be true on him. Jack placed an order with his Shenzhen supplier as regularly. His supplier produced the products as per their contract as usual.<\/p>\n<p>Before shipping out the cargoes to Jack, the customs examined the goods and seized the cargo. The customs said there\u2019s an issue of brand infringement. The brand belonged to a Guangzhou company. Jack was quite surprised by it. He has his brand in the U.S. He\u2019s been wondering how it happened.<\/p>\n<p>Actually, Jack had worked with another Chinese vendor in Guangzhou one time in 2014. The Guangzhou company registered their trademark in China. When Jack found out the truth, he was burned up.<\/p>\n<p>Jack wanted to sue the Guangzhou company. He employed a lawyer and contacted the American embassy in China. But Jack\u2019s company is not a big company, there was barely any progress. In the end, the Guangzhou company reached Jack and asked for US$80,000 as compensation before they let the customs withdraw the lawsuit.<\/p>\n<p>Jack ended up giving the company close to US$40,000 to get the customs to release the goods.<\/p>\n<p>Intellectual Property issues could happen worldwide not only in China. If you are developing your own brand, it\u2019s heavily suggested to register your trademark\/patent to protect yourself, especially where your vendor is located.<\/p>\n<p>Another issue could be that suppliers could display your products in their sample room, in the trade show or conference or on their website etc. To avoid such a case, you can make sure there\u2019s detail listed on the contract, stating clearly that it\u2019s not acceptable to use your design, patent and the like.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Category G: Importing practices<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; color: #fb7921;\"><strong style=\"background-color: transparent;\">25.100% rely on shipping carriers\/freight forwarders\/customs brokers for tax and duties<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Most clients would assume that freight forwarders and customs brokers are professionals and experts.

Customs brokers could be good at giving suggestions on tax and duty handling but it doesn\u2019t mean the suggested idea is correctly following the law. For example, some customs brokers helped loads of importers in using a duty-free HTS number. Chances are that it is the wrong HTS code as per your case.<\/p>\n<p>II. You are the importer and responsible to make sure everything is following laws and regulations, instead of the Customs brokers. If any issue happens, it is the importer who is responsible for the payment of all duties, taxes, and penalties.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; color: #fb7921;\">26. Try to play smart with Customs<\/span><br \/>\n<\/strong>A common example is that many importers deliberately undervalue shipments of goods, or mis-declare the product item as another in order to pay less amount of importing fees including taxes.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-745 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/customs.jpg\" alt=\"customs\" width=\"496\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/customs.jpg 496w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/customs-300x151.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/customs-260x131.jpg 260w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/customs-50x25.jpg 50w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/customs-150x75.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>What you could be expecting if your company engages such practices routinely?<\/p>\n<p>I.

Play fast and loose with paperwork<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We don\u2019t like documentation work but to import from China or other countries, it must involve in lots of paperwork. All documentation must be properly issued and stored. This is to avoid any significant delays in processing shipments or cargo being seized by customs.<\/p>\n<p>The paperwork includes Bill of lading, contracts, invoice, certificates for compliance etc.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #fb7921; font-size: 18pt;\">28.Import prohibited or regulated items<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Some countries prohibit importing certain product items for various reasons like anti-terrorism.<\/p>\n<p>Take Nigeria, for instance. Prohibited goods are like firearms, force uniforms, and many other items.<\/p>\n<p>Another situation is that many countries have regulated products. If you import specific product items from specific countries, it will be subject to additional import or special fees. Wood bedroom furniture is regulated by the U.S. against Chinese factories, whereas in some countries, it is a duty-free item.<\/p>\n<p>A significant factor leading to high duty rate and special fees is trade protectionism and anti-dumping. To avoid paying such extra fees, you need to research and check whether the product items you are going to import is good to go. Plus, you need to make sure your Chinese suppliers are not on the list of any anti-dumping or related blacklist.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #fb7921; font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>29.Incoterms mistakes<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-750 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Incoterms-Ref.jpg\" alt=\"Incoterms Ref\" width=\"750\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Incoterms-Ref.jpg 750w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Incoterms-Ref-600x320.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Incoterms-Ref-300x160.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Incoterms-Ref-260x139.jpg 260w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Incoterms-Ref-50x27.jpg 50w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Incoterms-Ref-141x75.jpg 141w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>29.1 Fail to specify the precise port\/place.

Imagine you are the supplier.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/get-suppliers-respond\"><u>Why not respond to the request<\/u><\/a>?<br \/>\nWhy ask for MOQ?<br \/>\nWhy not compromise in the pricing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/negotiate-with-suppliers\"><u>negotiation<\/u><\/a>?<br \/>\nWhy ask for 30% advance payment?<br \/>\n&#8230; &#8230;<\/p>\n<p>If you are in the supplier\u2019s shoes, you have a higher chance to know what they are paying close attention to. Business is about exchanging.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes your suppliers don\u2019t understand you. Sometimes you don\u2019t understand them. The point is to figure out what obstructs. Know what on earth is going on and then \u201ceducate\u201d each other. Let your supplier know why you have a particular request and how you are going to fit together.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>You May Also Like These Posts<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/before-getting-a-product-manufactured\">Pre-Order Checklist To Avoid You Making Losses<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/chinese-holidays-2017\">Don\u2019t let Chinese holidays 2017 delay your goods!<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/handle-a-sample-order\">How to Handle Your Sample Order<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Avoid these costly mistakes that most importers learned the hard way when they deal with Chinese suppliers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":752,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[10],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/739"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=739"}],"version-history":[{"count":11,"href":"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/739\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":18057,"href":"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/739\/revisions\/18057"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/752"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=739"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=739"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=739"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
