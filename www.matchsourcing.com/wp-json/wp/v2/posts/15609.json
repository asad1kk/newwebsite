They might be producing a certain type of jewelry or manufacturing a whole range of pieces to offer the buyers. The changing fashion trends make sure that all the products you buy stay relevant at some point in time, spelling profits for your business. Stepping into retailing jewelry is profitable whether you do it online on sites like Shopify or eBay or open an offline store in your neighborhood.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Types of Jewelry to Import from China<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-15612 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Varieties-in-trinkets.jpg\" alt=\"Varieties in trinkets\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Varieties-in-trinkets.jpg 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Varieties-in-trinkets-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Source: Pexels<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wholesale jewelry manufacturers in China will primarily be dealing with gold, silver, diamond, and platinum jewelry for importing into other countries. But apart from these, the jewelry made from metal alloys, aluminum, titanium, zirconia, and copper are also manufactured in huge quantities. Getting into the wholesale business would not be worth it if the products are not worth selling.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a customer demands jewelry made from gemstones, pearls, beads, and materials like Swarovski crystal, wood, seashells, and coconut shells, it can be manufactured by a wholesale supplier. Custom manufacturing may be differently priced, but it is a common practice done by jewelry manufacturers in China.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The imitation jewelry business is also thriving in China. There are numerous wholesale markets the buyers can directly visit and negotiate deals at. Other than this, finding factories or local manufacturers depending on the services and price is supremely easy in China because the jewelry manufacture and import business are very commonplace.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether it is <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.utsavfashion.com\/accessories\/imitation-jewelry\" target=\"_blank\"  rel=\"nofollow\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">imitation jewelry<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, custom jewelry, and wholesale jewelry, offer the buyers a very diverse choice to choose from. If you are starting a business in jewelry retail, you would first need to know which type of jewelry wholesale would suit your business based on quality, price, and demand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to Find Jewelry Manufacturers in China<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-15614 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Research-sales-trends-for-jewelry.jpg\" alt=\"Research sales trends for jewelry\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Research-sales-trends-for-jewelry.jpg 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Research-sales-trends-for-jewelry-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Source: Pexels<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After you know what you are going to buy from the wholesale jewelry supplier in China, you need to understand how to find a <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/custom-jewelry-manufacturers-in-china\">good jewelry supplier in China<\/a><\/span>. First, you will need to understand your requirements as an importer. The many importers located around the world fall into the following categories:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jewelry trading company<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online retail stores<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jewelry shops, Craft stores, souvenir shops, and gift shops.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supermarket chains<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fast fashion retailers or chains<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of these importers do business via a sourcing agent who is based in China and assists the internationally located importer with finalizing the purchase. Typically, the fees for a sourcing agent in China can fall anywhere between 1-10% of the factory price. The commission will also depend on the order quantity and the type of product you are buying. The price of hiring a sourcing agent might be worth it if you are new in the business because it will rid you of the stress of doing everything yourself remotely. The only con to finding a sourcing agent is the commission which can significantly impact your budget. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Know the Wholesale Markets<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-15615 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/There-is-variety-at-wholesale-markets.jpg\" alt=\"There is variety at wholesale markets\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/There-is-variety-at-wholesale-markets.jpg 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/There-is-variety-at-wholesale-markets-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Source: Unsplash<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suppose you are an independent importer looking to find a reliable wholesale jewelry supplier in China without involving a sourcing agent. In that case, you can visit the wholesale jewelry markets once to understand the business better. The wholesale jewelry markets in China include the Guangzhou market, the Yiwu market, and the Qingdao market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qingdao market primarily deals with the wholesale of Korean jewelry.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guangzhou market is the most famous wholesale market in China, with quality jewelry and clothes available for wholesale. The quality is good, and the price is competitive, but if you are looking for variety, you will find it here. Prominent markets in Guangzhou include the Langang market, Taikang Road market, and Liwan Plaza.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yiwu market has a smaller minimum order quantity or MOQ as compared to other wholesale suppliers. The MOQ in these markets is 100 units. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Other ways to find Suppliers<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-15616 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Trade-shows-will-help-your-business.jpg\" alt=\"Trade shows will help your business\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Trade-shows-will-help-your-business.jpg 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Trade-shows-will-help-your-business-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Source: Unsplash<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other than these markets, there are many different ways to find the right supplier for your jewelry business. As a jewelry business, there are many ways you can find exporters and wholesale suppliers from China. They can be found via the MatchSourcing website. You can visit international trade shows to get acquainted with some of the manufacturers who have presented their manufactured goods in their booths. You can go on searching, or you can finalize a supplier for your business there and then. This way, you would not have to pay for a sourcing agent.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are business-to-business or B2B websites that also work to help manufacturers and importers meet no matter the physical distance between them. If you are determined to find an exporter yourself, research will do you good. You should explore the Facebook and LinkedIn pages of manufacturers and then compare them to what other suppliers are offering. The internet will help you with your research, comparing and contrasting, and negotiating. You can also look to get referrals online so that you get a reduced price from the wholesale manufacturers in China. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Jewelry Suppliers on the Web<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-15617 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Know-what-to-look-for.jpg\" alt=\"Know what to look for\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Know-what-to-look-for.jpg 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Know-what-to-look-for-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Source: Unsplash<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">China&#8217;s jewelry wholesale business is very popular.

The most common types of supplier audit you can ask for are:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethical Audits: Focusing on social accountability, these audits verify that the workers in the factory are being treated well and that the manufacturer is not engaging in practices that can damage the environment.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manufacturing Audit: This audit will determine if the factory is up to professional standards and will produce quality products for you.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Structural Audit: This has to do with the safety of the workers in the factory and works to protect your brand image if you are affiliated with this supplier. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Always Negotiate with Jewelry Manufacturers in China<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-15619 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Know-the-market-price-of-jewellery-you-are-buying.jpg\" alt=\"Know the market price of jewellery you are buying\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Know-the-market-price-of-jewellery-you-are-buying.jpg 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Know-the-market-price-of-jewellery-you-are-buying-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Source: Unsplash<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The whole negotiation process, while you are engaging with Chinese jewelry wholesale suppliers, can be broken down into steps. There is an inherent acceptance in the suppliers that the buyer would not expect the quoted price. Negotiation is expected, which is why the offered price at first will be higher than expected. You should go with a target price in mind and then ask the supplier to match it. Chances are, a middle ground will be reached. Don&#8217;t be afraid to walk away.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The increased price can be due to a high minimum order quantity. If you go to a wholesale market, you will find that the minimum order quantity does not vary much from vendor to vendor. This is because of competition. You can negotiate in this case, but you can lose business if you stray too far from the quoted price. Research on what is the price for wholesale. If you are researching online and want to find a supplier via the internet, you can look for the typical pricing and MOQ and negotiate with sellers accordingly. There might not be enough room for negotiation if you are on a B2B website because these websites operate on set limits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Be Prepared with Additional Costs<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-15620 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Manufacturing-cost-can-should-be-looked-into.jpg\" alt=\"Manufacturing cost can should be looked into\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Manufacturing-cost-can-should-be-looked-into.jpg 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Manufacturing-cost-can-should-be-looked-into-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Source: Pexels<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The price of a particular piece can also be inflated depending upon the manufacturing cost. Sometimes the cost of a product turns out to be higher than expected. This can increase the price quoted to customers. Other than this, the better the quality of a certain product, the higher its rate would be. For example, the rates in the Guangzhou wholesale market are competitive because of the good quality pieces available there. If you opt for custom designs, that will also lead the suppliers to increase the price of their services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shipping cost is also a significant factor when it comes to the price of the products. Even though jewelry manufacturers have their own deals with shipping companies, the prices of freight services have increased in the previous years, which has also increased the cost for the manufacturers exporting their wares. Understand the pricing in shipping before negotiating the price for the shipping jewelry. Also, account for the time it will take to ship the products. If the shipping is fast, it will cost you more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Licensing and Payment<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-15621 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Know-all-the-possible-methods-of-payment.jpg\" alt=\"Know all the possible methods of payment\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Know-all-the-possible-methods-of-payment.jpg 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Know-all-the-possible-methods-of-payment-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Source: Pexels<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you finalize anything, ask for audits, licenses, and the store card of the jewelry manufacturer. You can also ask for a sample jewelry piece before making an order. This will help you authenticate the business and its services. You can contact your jewelry supplier formally via email so that all of your interactions have a reliable record that you can refer to later.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The payment of the services can be made via a variety of methods. These include using PayPal, wire transfer\/Telegraphic Transfer (TT), and Letter of Credit (LOC). This is accepted all around the world, and the suppliers would prefer this method as it is the most common.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to source and <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/sourcing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">import jewelry from China<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">,<\/span> it is not difficult if you know how to go about the process.
