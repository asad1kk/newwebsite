Before Alibaba, it was extremely difficult for international buyers to connect with Chinese suppliers, but Alibaba has now made it easy to meet suppliers, source quality products, and build long-lasting relationships.<\/p><h3><strong>Main Features of Alibaba:<\/strong><\/h3><p><strong>Product types <\/strong><\/p><p>Everything from electronics to clothing, to vehicles. There is almost nothing that\u00a0you can imagine that isn\u2019t for sale on the website as it is one of the biggest wholesale markets online.<\/p><p><strong>Supplier types<\/strong><\/p><p>There are three main types of suppliers on Alibaba:\u00a0factories, trading companies &amp; wholesalers.<\/p><p><strong>Buyer safety<\/strong><\/p><p>Buyers are offered the option of \u201cTrade Assurance\u201d whereby any order which is not delivered on time or to the standard expected is fully refunded.<\/p><p><strong>Quality assurance<\/strong><\/p><p>Alibaba provides independent product inspection which can happen at various stages of the production to ensure that everything is up to scratch.<\/p><p><strong>Minimum order sizes<\/strong><\/p><p>There is no set minimum order size but it is up to the seller how few items they are willing to sell. The majority of trade done on the website is wholesale and most sellers will expect you to buy in bulk.<\/p><p><strong>Payment options<\/strong><\/p><p>Multiple payment methods are available including bank transfers, credit cards, e-checking, Western Union,\u00a0and the website\u2019s own AliPay system. A \u201cSecure Payment\u201d feature is also offered so the seller doesn\u2019t receive the money until the order has been delivered and checked.<\/p><p><strong>Shipping Options<\/strong><\/p><p>Various shipping methods are available through Alibaba&#8217;s own logistics service such as FedEx, DHL, and many others. Buyers can also discuss using \u00a0their own shipping agent or the supplier&#8217;s shipping agents.<\/p><h3><strong>Ease of Use<\/strong><\/h3><p>One downside of Alibaba is that many people find that the website\u2019s interface is not very user-friendly. There are also issues with prices not being promptly updated.<\/p><h3><strong>Alibaba is <\/strong><strong>Recommended for\u2026<\/strong><\/h3><p>Everyone who is looking to buy products in bulk from reputable suppliers and beginner buyers who are nervous about the process.<\/p><h2><strong>Aliexpress<\/strong><\/h2><p>AliExpress is part of the Alibaba group which puts an emphasis on smaller orders of products from China. It is a very safe and fast China wholesale website. All buyers need to do is add products to their cart and then checkout just like they would with Amazon.<\/p><h3><strong>Main Features of Aliexpress:<\/strong><\/h3><p><strong>Product types<\/strong><\/p><p>Aliexpress mostly deals with end consumer products such as shoes, bags, clothing,\u00a0and other items. Unlike other wholesale websites, there are few big industrial products available on Aliexpress.<\/p><p><strong>Supplier types<\/strong><\/p><p>Aliexpress has four main types of suppliers: manufacturers, traders, distributors\/wholesalers, and dropshippers\/retailers.<\/p><p><strong>Buyer safety<\/strong><\/p><p>Aliexpress ensures buyer safety with their two-year Extra Warranty, and with a Refund Guarantee service. If your products do not arrive on time or are not of good quality, buyers are given their money back.<\/p><p><strong>Quality assurance<\/strong><\/p><p>Aliexpress is predominantly a marketplace, however, buyers are able to see customer reviews and ratings for all sellers on the website.<\/p><p><strong>Minimum order sizes<\/strong><\/p><p>Most sellers have no minimum order quantity and there is a tiered pricing system in place. The price of each unit decreases the more volume is purchased but the prices at Aliexpress are not competitive for large wholesale orders.<\/p><p><strong>Payment options<\/strong><\/p><p>There are various payment methods available on Aliexpress including Western Union, Paypal, and wire transfer. Aliexpress also uses its own Aliexpress pocket which is a gift card system for payments.<\/p><p><strong>Shipping Options<\/strong><\/p><p>Affordable shipping through China post which will take anywhere between 15 days and 50 days. Buyers can alternatively use ePacket or Aliexpress Shipping which takes around 15 days or pay for express shipping through UPS, DHL or FedEx.<\/p><h3><strong>Ease of Use<\/strong><\/h3><p>Aliexpress has a very quick and easy ordering process. With worldwide delivery and a built-in shopping cart, it is a winner for anyone looking to make smaller orders from China.<\/p><h3><strong>Aliexpress is Recommended for\u2026<\/strong><\/h3><p>Many sellers on AliExpress offer dropshipping which makes AliExpress the number one choice for small businesses and startups looking to sell products online without having their own warehouse.<\/p><h2><strong>DHgate<\/strong><\/h2><p>DHgate acts as a middle man between wholesalers and buyers. It has had some problems in the past with product quality and delivery and communication issues. DHgate has made some positive steps to address some of the problems and it can now be a very good website to use as long as you do your due diligence.<\/p><h3><strong>Main Features of DHgate:<\/strong><\/h3><p><strong>Product types<\/strong><\/p><p>DHgate has more than 30 million Chinese products available on its website, from electronics to jewelry to clothing. It is very important to remember that the vast majority of branded items are going to be fakes. This may be what you are looking for but remember that it is illegal in many countries to import counterfeits.<\/p><p><strong>Supplier types<\/strong><\/p><p>Suppliers are predominantly manufacturers which enables the prices to stay super low.<\/p><p><strong>Buyer safety<\/strong><\/p><p>DHgate uses an Escrow Payment Model so the money is not given to the seller until the buyer has confirmed receipt. Some suppliers have previously just used stock photos so the item that was delivered was not right. DHgate will give you a refund in this situation.<\/p><p><strong>Quality assurance<\/strong><\/p><p>Buyers can request a full refund if the quality of the products is not up to scratch or get a partial if they decide to keep the items.<\/p><p><strong>Minimum order sizes<\/strong><\/p><p>Similar to Aliexpress, DHgate uses a tiered pricing system with no set minimum quantity of orders. The more items are purchased, the cheaper each unit becomes.<\/p><p><strong>Payment options<\/strong><\/p><p>Multiple payment methods are available on DHgate including bank transfer (from certain countries), credit card, Paypal, Western Union,\u00a0and more.<\/p><p><strong>Shipping methods<\/strong><\/p><p>Delivery time can be very slow from DHgate unless you pay for express delivery. One positive development is the launch of DHStorage, with DHgate warehouses now in the US and UK storing products for purchase. Buyers in these countries can usually expect orders coming from these websites in 2-5 working days.<\/p><h3><strong>Ease of Use<\/strong><\/h3><p>When buying on DHgate, due diligence is needed. Make sure you check the credentials and reviews of suppliers before you deal with them. One issue which is regularly flagged by users is the poor search algorithm which can make finding products difficult.<\/p><h3><strong>DHgate is Recommended for\u2026<\/strong><\/h3><p>Customers looking for the cheapest possible items who know how to do the required checks on products and suppliers.<\/p><h2><strong>1688<\/strong><strong>.com<\/strong><\/h2><p>1688.com is not only a site which offers individual buyers a huge range of quality products, it is also where the other wholesale companies do their shopping. With some of the cheapest prices anywhere in the world, it is an incredible source of products.<\/p><h3><strong>Main Features of 1688<\/strong><strong>.com<\/strong><\/h3><p><strong>Product types<\/strong><\/p><p>1688 has an enormous range of every type of product available for a great price which is why so many other wholesale companies buy from this website.<\/p><p><strong>Supplier types<\/strong><\/p><p>1688 has a collection of almost all suppliers in China, both manufacturers,\u00a0and wholesalers. One downside to 1688 is that much of the trade is done between Chinese sellers and buyers and so there may be language issues for international buyers.<\/p><p><strong>Buyer safety<\/strong><\/p><p>All sellers require a business license from the government before they can sell on 1688. Buyers can check these licenses on the website.<\/p><p><strong>Quality assurance<\/strong><\/p><p>International buyers can pay agents within China to inspect their products before they are shipped.<\/p><p><strong>Minimum order sizes<\/strong><\/p><p>There is no minimum order size and many sellers will allow you to just buy one or two units. This can be a good way to check the quality of the products and reliability of the seller before you make a bigger order.<\/p><p><strong>Payment methods<\/strong><\/p><p>Most suppliers will only deal with local payment methods so international buyers will need to enlist a buying agency to help them make purchases.<\/p><p><strong>Shipping methods<\/strong><\/p><p>Shipping has to be arranged between buyer and seller. Most sellers do not have the necessary export license because they do the majority of their trade domestically. You will, therefore, need to hire a buying agent to help arrange the import from China.<\/p><h3><strong>Ease of Use<\/strong><\/h3><p>The language barrier and the necessity for buying agents mean that 1688 is not the easiest website for international customers to use.<\/p><h3><strong>1688 is Recommended for\u2026<\/strong><\/h3><p>Experienced buyers, those with Chinese language abilities, and buyers who already have strong relationships with buying agents.<\/p><h2><strong>Made<\/strong><strong>&#8211;<\/strong><strong>in<\/strong><strong>&#8211;<\/strong><strong>China.com <\/strong><\/h2><p>Formed in 1998, Made-In-China is one the oldest Chinese wholesale websites which connects Chinese suppliers and manufacturers with buyers around the world.

Few small traders as they cannot compete for price.<\/p><p><strong>Buyer safety<\/strong><\/p><p>A big advantage of Made-in-China is the Online Sourcing Meeting which allows buyers to talk to sellers over video chat.<\/p><p><strong>Quality assurance<\/strong><\/p><p>Made-in-China offers various products which have won an MEI (manufacturing excellence and innovation) award. These awards are categorized as gold, silver,\u00a0and bronze.<\/p><p><strong>Minimum order quantity<\/strong><\/p><p>Buyers are usually required to order hundreds of units on Made-in-China.<\/p><p><strong>Payment methods<\/strong><\/p><p>Paypal is usually best for small orders but large goods are best paid for through Western Union, bank wire,\u00a0or L\/C.<\/p><p><strong>Shipping methods<\/strong><\/p><p>Suppliers will usually recommend buyers ship by sea and this can take weeks. For a faster delivery time, buyers can use DHL, FedEx,\u00a0or another courier.<\/p><h3><strong>Ease of Use<\/strong><\/h3><p>This is not the easiest website to buy China wholesale goods and in general,\u00a0does not have a great user rating. This is partly due to the language barrier and cultural differences.<\/p><h3><strong>Recommended for\u2026<\/strong><\/h3><p>Buyers with experience on China wholesale websites as well as those ordering industrial and construction products in bulk.<\/p><h2><strong>Global Sources <\/strong><\/h2><p>Global Market is another major website which connects manufacturers with businesses and buyers.

You will find many of the same suppliers at the trade shows selling on the website.<\/p><p><strong>Buyer safety<\/strong><\/p><p>Global Sources has 8 strict benchmark tests which every supplier and business must pass to obtain their Global Manufacturer Certificate (GMC). These include quality control, manufacturing facility inspections, and environmental responsibility.<\/p><p><strong>Quality assurance<\/strong><\/p><p>The GMC assures the quality of the products on the Global Sources website.<\/p><p><strong>Minimum order quantity<\/strong><\/p><p>The minimum requirements for orders on Global Sources are\u00a0around $1,000 t0 $5,000.<\/p><p><strong>Payment methods<\/strong><\/p><p>Payment methods\u00a0can be agreed upon between buyer and seller.

You will need to agree on a shipping method with the supplier.<\/p><h3><strong>Ease of Use<\/strong><\/h3><p>Global Sources website is very easy to use and the focus it puts on exhibitions and trade shows has\u00a0made it very successful. The lack of well-defined shipping and payment channels, however, means\u00a0that many beginners may struggle with making purchases on the platform.<\/p><h3><strong>Global Sources is <\/strong><strong>Recommended for\u2026<\/strong><\/h3><p>Experts in buying Chinese wholesale products and those who are looking for big orders.<\/p><h2><strong>HKTDC <\/strong><\/h2><p>Hong Kong Trade Development Council is a highly respected Chinese wholesale website based in Hong Kong. HKTDC provides both an online marketplace and a platform for Hong Kong traders to progress.<\/p><h3><strong>Main Features of HKTDC<\/strong><\/h3><p><strong>Product types<\/strong><\/p><p>Every kind of product from electronics to jewelry and textiles, premium items, gifts,\u00a0and much much more.<\/p><p><strong>Supplier types<\/strong><\/p><p>A mixture of large and small suppliers offering products to buy wholesale.
