Place an order disregarding the language barrier<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">If your Chinese manufacturer and you are saying different languages, it\u2019s really hard to make sure everything is understood 100% correctly by each party. Even both parties are speaking the same language (<em>English for example<\/em>), there could be little misunderstanding time and again. It\u2019s because most Chinese sales speak English but as a second language.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">You might have the access to direct manufacturers (via 1688 or other directories that Chinese factories converge), yet the factories don\u2019t export themselves and don\u2019t have sales who can speak English. You want to cut out all third parties and middlemen for lower import expenses. As a result, you may use a translation tool to talk business with the factory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">What would happen if two parties are talking about different things but they think it\u2019s the same thing? It\u2019s especially difficult to get the correct meaning for product specification terms as the translation tool can\u2019t interpret 100% right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">A little investment on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/\"><u>trustworthy language assistance<\/u><\/a> to make sure everything clear V.S.

Wait for a perfect supplier<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; background-color: transparent;\">You want a supplier to provide the best quality, pricing, service, lead time, payment term, trade term and on, expecting the entire cooperation process to be 100% smoothly without any accident or mistake. You wait and wait for a perfect supplier to come whereas your competitors have already grabbed 80% market.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">When you finally decide to catch the market, the trend already passes. There is actually no such thing as a perfect supplier. Problems will happen during your cooperation with suppliers, no matter small or big. We advocate the pursuit of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/how-to-find-suppliers\"><u>best fit vendor<\/u><\/a> that can right match your business requests. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">To find the \u201cbest\u201d(best fit) suppliers, you will need to educate them and there is going to be a running-in period. Some suppliers that don\u2019t well fit will be filtered out. Some will learn how to match and stay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #fb7921; font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>17.Request to be an exclusive agency without preparation<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">You want to have the exclusive selling rights and request to be your vendor\u2019s exclusive seller in the xxx area or some parts of the country or even the whole country. But you get a NO from your vendor. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>The common reason to request to sign an exclusive agreement with vendors?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">You may notice your vendor supply the same product items to other clients in the same area where you are selling. It\u2019s because your products have very good sales, your competitors in the same market area find your vendor for supplies and carve up the market. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">It means that your previous investment of time, money for marketing and promotion is literally done for your competitors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Why would your vendor say NO to you?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rights and duties are equal. Suppliers won\u2019t give whatever clients ask. If you want to sell exclusively, your vendor will want more orders for exchange. Ask your supplier to give up their other order profits is basically against the business nature in their perspective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">As a result, if you want a positive answer from your vendor, you have to show your order plan, strategic marketing, and potential. Give your supplier a reason to say YES to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; color: #fb7921;\"><strong>18.Being a too nice\/easy buyer<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">If you are way too nice when dealing with suppliers, chances are that you will be ripped off.

The \u201cafter\u201d refers to you becoming an actual client. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Many clients import from the same Chinese manufacturer for years with the same \u201ccooperation system\u201d. Actually, it\u2019s viable to try to negotiate better terms for your continued orders. It\u2019s about supply chain management tactic and strategy, avoiding any chance for the supplier to be lax on your orders.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">Category E: Quality Control<\/span>\u00a0<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-724\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/quality-assurance-quality-control-1024x296.jpg\" alt=\"quality-assurance-quality-control\" width=\"1024\" height=\"296\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/quality-assurance-quality-control-1024x296.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/quality-assurance-quality-control-600x173.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/quality-assurance-quality-control-300x87.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/quality-assurance-quality-control-768x222.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/quality-assurance-quality-control-260x75.jpg 260w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/quality-assurance-quality-control-50x14.jpg 50w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/quality-assurance-quality-control-150x43.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/quality-assurance-quality-control.jpg 1038w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; color: #fb7921;\"><strong>19.Fail to follow up your orders<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Figuring out all the previous tasks before placing an order with your Chinese supplier is a lot of work.
