One single country cannot be able to provide all these needs for its business class. Due to this, business people have opted to import whatever they require from other countries.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, importation used to be a hectic process as there was the absence of the technology we have at our disposal in the current times. There is one country that stands out in this market, and this is China. The advantage of importing from China is that you have different methods to do so, either by yourself or using <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/\"><b>sourcing agents<\/b><\/a><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You will notice that a huge percentage of items we buy usually have the words \u2018made in China\u2019. China is the largest exporter of goods in the world since 2009.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite being a major manufacturer of a vast category of items, China also has products that it&#8217;s known for. Everyone has preferences, and some people believe that when a certain item is not made in China then it may be substandard. As much as stereotypes also exist, there is no arguing that most of our households have these Chinese products, and they serve just very well. For the toy industry, many toys sellers source cheap and quality toys from China.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Why Import Toys from China<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-15680 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Packaged-boxes.jpg\" alt=\"Packaged boxes\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Packaged-boxes.jpg 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Packaged-boxes-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Source: Unsplash<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">China is a leading manufacturer of toys around the world. The \u2018made in china\u2019 label is so common in toys that it is almost hard to believe that there are other manufacturers too. Anytime you search for any type of toy online, you will find it on Chinese vendor websites. China produces a large variety of toys. All you have to do is ask for it, and you have it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of this, most local vendors opt to import toys from China. Everyone wants to try something that has been used and tested by someone else so as to avoid risk. China has made a name for itself, and the various manufacturers are reaping the fruits of this. They don&#8217;t even have to advertise and market themselves, just being based in China does it for them. This has helped even the upcoming companies in the country. However, there are strict measures <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you must take before you start your importation process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Why are Toys made in China<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-15681 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/A-robot-toy.jpg\" alt=\"A robot toy\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/A-robot-toy.jpg 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/A-robot-toy-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Source: Unsplash<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">China, as we have seen, is a leader in the manufacturing industry. We have outlined the various products manufactured in China, and it is clear that toys are a big part of this production. The toys business is a major contribution to economic growth, and it is very vast all over the world. It is estimated that 140millon children will be born in the year 2021 alone. So we can clearly understand why this market sector is very wide since most of these kids will be in need of these.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parents like to go all out when it comes to their children, and one child can own as many toys as one parent can buy. Production has to be consistent due to the high demand across the world, and China has definitely managed to keep up with this. There are factors that give China an advantage when it comes to the manufacture of toys which include;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Low labor costs: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">China is home to more than 1.3 billion people. Due to this large population, there is a huge number of laborers who want to make a living. When there is a high demand for jobs, the wages are usually relatively low enabling these toy factories to achieve bulk productions and keep to clients\u2019 timelines without having to spend so much on paying their workers.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Compliance:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There are set standards for any product being manufactured, and they have to be strictly adhered to, and toys are not an exception. There are bodies that are in charge of inspection of these items to ensure that the manufacturers have adhered to the standards. China manufacturing companies have been known to follow these guidelines very closely. This is very important to ensure <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/kidshealth.org\/en\/parents\/safe-toys.html\" target=\"_blank\"  rel=\"nofollow\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">kids\u2019 safety<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while playing with these toys.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Skilled workers: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The presence of people with the right skills and expertise in the production of toys has enabled China to produce some of the best toys.

Before closing on any transaction, you have to make sure that some things are agreed upon both by the seller and the buyer. This is very important, especially in international trade, because of the long distance between the two. The time and money spent in such transactions are too much for any careless mistakes that could have been avoided. You have to prepare a<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/before-getting-a-product-manufactured\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> pre-order checklist<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to attain this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>MOQ: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This refers to minimum order quantity. A supplier should be clear on the minimum order a client has to make in order for the business to close. Most factories in China manufacture toys in huge bulks and therefore do not allow for small orders. This should be made clear to the buyer beforehand.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Quality: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A buyer, with the help of their sourcing agent, should be able to inspect the quality of the toys before importation. It is advisable to start by inspecting the raw materials being used for manufacture to ensure they are up to standard. The toys should then be inspected after manufacture to determine they are quality, and the last inspection should take place just before shipping, usually to confirm quantity too.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Pricing:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is a very important aspect of trade. Both parties must agree on pricing before any other step is taken. It is a good thing that the <\/span><b>toys price in china <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is relatively low, so most buyers get through this step after much negotiation. A sourcing agent is very critical in this process.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Lead Time: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A timeline should be agreed upon, from the beginning of production to the shipping. This enables both parties to plan themselves accordingly. In instances where delays occur, there should always be communication regarding the same.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Custom duties: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are the costs involved in the shipping process. China has its own custom duty rates that have to be paid before any goods leave the country. Your supplier or <\/span><b>sourcing agent<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will advise on these rates.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Shipping:<\/b> You should be able to decide on the<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/shipping-from-china-2\"> best shipping method <\/a><\/span><\/span>that will work for you even before the production of your toys begins. You can either use air, which is usually on the higher side cost-wise, by sea or by rail. Shipping by sea is one of the most commonly used methods because it is more cost-friendly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>China Toy Manufacturers<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-15689 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/A-kid-on-a-tricycle.jpg\" alt=\"A kid on a tricycle\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/A-kid-on-a-tricycle.jpg 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/A-kid-on-a-tricycle-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Source: Pixabay<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">China has a wide variety of toy manufacturers across the various provinces in the country. Each manufacturer has specialised in the production of certain kinds of toys. When sourcing for toys, you should consider narrowing down to one manufacturer to avoid going back, and both with different manufactures as this can be very hectic for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These manufacturing companies have helped the Chinese economy a great deal by contributing to the general revenue and also creating lots of job opportunities for the citizens, therefore, lowering the poverty rates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Woodfield Toys Limited: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They deal in the manufacture of plush and soft toys, which include; playmats, rattles, teethers.

Sourcing agents are in a better position to do this because they are on the ground and can gather as much information as possible. You can also run these checks over the internet by reading reviews and testimonials. However, we have to admit that some of these online reviews on the internet are cooked to give a business advantage. Ask your sourcing agent to supply you with this information before settling on a supplier for your toys.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This audit is important because there are instances where you find that a supplier is also outsourcing products and pretending that they are theirs. In such scenarios, you might end up with substandard items and end up running huge losses. Audits also help to determine if a supplier is known for using standard raw materials and if they are able to keep to the timeline. The overall goal is to find the best toy supplier who will be able to keep their end of the bargain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The China toy market is huge and diverse.
