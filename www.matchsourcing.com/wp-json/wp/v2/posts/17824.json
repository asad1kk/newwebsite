The problem lies in the fact that this working model requires a lot of overhead expenses and tends to burden one party with everything from receiving the order to the packaging of it to delivering it. The cost of keeping products on hand (viz. maintaining an inventory), storing it safely (viz. warehousing), and fulfilling the orders (viz. labors, packaging, and shipping) can be very burdensome especially for the local businesses or the ones that are just starting out. Hence, it&#8217;s important to understand what dropshipping is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Is Dropshipping? \u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17825\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Dropshipping-services.jpg\" alt=\"Dropshipping-services\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Dropshipping-services.jpg 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Dropshipping-services-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freepik.com\/free-vector\/courier-carrying-order-delivering-parcel-express-cargo-delivery-service-air-freight-logistics-distribution-global-postal-mail-concept-pinkish-coral-bluevector-isolated-illustration_11667241.htm#page=1&amp;query=dropshipping&amp;position=11&amp;from_view=search\" target=\"_blank\"  rel=\"nofollow\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freepik<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dropshipping is a feasible option that has been surfacing when it comes to avoiding these overhead expenses.
