CE mark implies the product\u2019s compliance along with strict EU standards and regulations.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But do you know that often the CE mark on products can be fake?

It is still necessary to be able to distinguish the original CE mark from the fake &#8220;Chinese Export&#8221; mark. But how? Let us see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is CE Mark Important?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17889\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Important-symbol.jpg\" alt=\"Important symbol\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Important-symbol.jpg 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Important-symbol-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freepik.com\/free-photo\/important-significant-priority-notice-concept_18042627.htm#page=1&amp;query=important&amp;position=1&amp;from_view=search\" target=\"_blank\"  rel=\"nofollow\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freepik<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne abbreviated to CE literally means European Conformity. If you ask, in simple terms, it is a kind of necessary certification required by the manufacturers, and suppliers if they are willing to trade in the European region. It straightforwardly implies that the products having this said mark ensures us that the product complies with the applied health, safety, and environmental regulations issued within the EU.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a very necessary quality check required for businesses to freely operate and trade in the EU. What kind of quality checks, and certifications are required by your product really varies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many certifications that apply to certain products while some of them need to be applied to all the products, irrespective of the product type.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CE marking is one of the widely used, most trusted quality standards in the EU, without which trading of certain products is considered highly illegal. The European Standards Committee has created a set of harmonized standards. Only those products bearing a CE marking are said to be following these regulated harmonized specifications and are considered safe enough to be launched into the market and consumed by consumers freely.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now the next question is: What happens if we do not CE mark our products? Is there any consequence if we fail to get our products CE marked? Well, here is the answer. If the products are not appropriately CE marked, they are considered illegal and unfit to be brought to market. However, it should be noted that the legal consequences depend really on the principles of national legislation at the moment of judgment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do all the products require CE marking to be legally allowed to be traded in the EU? Although not all, most of the products traded in the EU need to be CE marked. Let us see what products need to be CE marked before bringing them to market:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medical devices\u00a0 and equipment<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cableways<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Active implantable medical components<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In-vitro diagnostic medical devices<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hot water boilers<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Construction products<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All types of machinery<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Low-voltage electrical equipment<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recreational craft<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Electric &amp; electronic equipments<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal protective equipment<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pressure equipment &amp; gas appliances<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Radio &amp; telecommunications terminal equipment<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lifts<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pyrotechnics<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Noise emitting devices in the environment<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cableways<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equipment used in explosive atmospheres<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Explosives for civil use<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Measuring equipment<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equipment with electromagnetic compatibility<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Non-automatic weighing instrument<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toys &amp; recreational craft<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Official CE Mark\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17890\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Original-and-official.jpg\" alt=\"Original and official\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Original-and-official.jpg 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Original-and-official-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/CE_marking\" target=\"_blank\"  rel=\"nofollow\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wikipedia<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all know that CE marking is a confirmation of compliance of the products manufactured with EU rules and regulations. Compliance with the necessary requirements of the necessary EU directives is meant for ensuring health, safety, and environmental protection.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The CE Mark is mandatory for specific products ( depending on their purpose and the materials they are composed of)\u00a0 that are sold in the European Economic Area (EEA).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are basically three entities involved in any business\/trade. This CE marking signifies that all three of them take responsibility for the quality standards of the products and assure the national authorities as well as the consumers that it wouldn\u2019t lead to life, safety, or any kind of environmental risks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>1.Manufacturers<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is the responsibility of the manufacturers to ensure that the products manufactured and launched in the extended market of the EEA are safe and risk-free for consumption. They need to carry out the conformity of compliance thoroughly and accurately, set up an assessment, deliver the correct technical reports, issue the EU declaration and affix the necessary CE marking, provided that products\/services are in compliance with all rules and regulations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>2.Importers &amp; Distributors<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Importers and distributors are the middlemen of this trading system. They should assure that only CE-marked products that declare that they are compliant with EU-issued regulations are allowed to be brought to the EEA market.\u00a0 Not adhering to this can lead to them being a major legal risk, and can empower the law to seize their authority of being a supplier.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>3.Consumers<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EU consumers are the receiving end. So it becomes our responsibility to see that the products we purchase are CE marked, and if not, consumers should report to the concerned authority right away.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The real CE mark has \u201cCE\u201d letters inscribed in bold. Sometimes, alongside the CE mark, there is a code that represents the ID number of the respective Notified body needed for conducting the product\u2019s assessment and certification.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CE Chinese Export Mark<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17891\" src=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/CE-VS-Chinese-CE-marking.jpg\" alt=\"CE VS Chinese CE-marking\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/CE-VS-Chinese-CE-marking.jpg 564w, https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/CE-VS-Chinese-CE-marking-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nl.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/CE-markering\" target=\"_blank\"  rel=\"nofollow\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wikipedia<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many-a-times, the CE \u201cChinese export\u201d mark can be seen on products produced and manufactured in, and exported from China. The spacing between the letters of the Chinese export mark is closer than the official CE marking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mark is very similar to the original CE mark when it comes to the design. It would be peculiarly impossible for you to distinguish between the two if you are not aware of the difference between them. This may result in you getting misled and considering your product to be CE marked and safe to use.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The \u201cChinese export\u201d mark is not an official\/legal European mark and is considered fake in the EU. Many factories in China apply that mark on their products and afterward, put them on the market. They do it in an attempt to trade their product without having the quality check done.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since such products haven\u2019t had any risk assessment, safety evaluation, or testing, there are high risks of them being unsafe and unhealthy to use. They haven\u2019t been certified against the relevant CE standards, and their placing on the EU market, which is seen as an illegal act can lead to serious legal consequences for the manufacturer. If you want to check it out, power supplies usually have a fake CE Chinese export label.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a nutshell, even though the \u201cChinese export\u201d mark resembles the official European CE Mark, it doesn\u2019t strictly imitate its dimensions or proportions. For this reason, the letters are formed identically, but the spacing between them is different. This is precisely what differentiates the two marks. A correct CE mark has the E started on the circular profile drawn out by the C character.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many Chinese sourcing agents who deal with these things using <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.matchsourcing.com\/quality-inspection\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">China control quality inspection services<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
