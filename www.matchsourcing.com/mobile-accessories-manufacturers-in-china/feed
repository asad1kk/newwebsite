					<description><![CDATA[My name is Mohammad Usman from Multan Pakistan
On November 26, 2023, I purchased one Chinese Vivo V29E from Vivo Board Shop for my personal use.Purchased from my city Multan, Pakistan and the sticker of PTA Approl IMI was also attached on the back of the box of this mobile.
There were multiple problems with the mobile which I initially reported to vivo&#039;s helpline whatsapp number in Pakistan which is 04235711032.
Once again on 29th January 2024 I registered my complaint of multiple complaint on Vivo whatsapp helpline number which is 04235710132.
One of the multi-problems was the problem of the camera, the angle of the photo was not correct
Another problem was that saved numbers were getting deleted from my contact list in my mobile
My third problem was that I told them that my mobile is working slowly
The fourth complaint was about the value of my mobile phone being down under the policy of vivo Company Pakistan, which 
My status is End consumer and consumer company is family member
Vivo customer center gave me some links on mobile slow which didn&#039;t work but still the mobile got slow.
On 4th February 2024 I called vivo customer care center its number is (061) 6212543 and they guided me.
I contacted the nearest Vivo customer care center and they helped me
Vivo customer care said that your mobile board will have to be replaced as your mobile is not under warranty so you have to pay
I was shocked to hear this from him.
I showed the vivo apps warranty card to the customer care center people and showed my mobile box which was tagged with PTA Government of Pakistan tag along the invoice of the vivo shop 
He said that no, this is your box, it is someone else, the physical mobile is something else, these mobiles are not from Pakistan.
Engineer and Manager of Vivo Customer Care Center checked the mobile thoroughly and agreed that They were saying that this mobile is patched
I got them to check imed with the code *#06# but they rejected the imei with this quote.
The customer care center checked their code with *#09# and it did not match the IMEi
The next day on February 5, 2024, I went to the shopkeeper, the vivo shop was open on February 5 because the company was closed, he asked February 6, 2024 me to come 
On February 6, 2024, I went to the mobile vivo shop with your goods 
The vivo shop keeper called Waqas, the representative of Vivo company official, his number is as follows 03054399701
Whatsapp 

After checking the product by the official representative of vivo company he confirmed that the mobile is patched he didn&#039;t help me he said that this problem will be solved by the vivo shop from whom you bought the mobile vivo shop Wave official Waqas said that this mobile is in the records of Taj Mobile, an agent bought the mobile from Taj Mobile and the agent sold the mobile to the vivo shop owner.
Vivo official Waqas ended his work by saying this and gave the option to sub vivo dealer to resolve or not to resolve the matter and we can&#039;t help you and move on.
This action of vivo official caused me a lot of pain but vivo official Waqas should have taken notice of this and completed the investigation and responded to me after doing the investigation but he left me at the mercy of Vivo Shop.
What is the one mistake I have made as a consumer family member of Vivo Mobile Company for which I am being punished so much?
The status of the end consumer gives profit to everyone from the factory manufacturer to the end retailer and if these consumers are harmed, how will it work?
If someone asks me how to use vivo mobile I will tell the truth I will never advise my family members, relatives, friends, customer staff to buy vivo mobile.
You should change your mobile features, packing, policy according to some SOPs so that this problem does not happen to anyone else. What happened to me is very bad. 
In case the issue was not resolved by local Vivo I contacted Vivo Internationals one of the following email complaintglobal@vivo.com Following are the updates after contacting them In the morning on monday 12th February 2024 i was contacted by vivo pakistan multan branch with the following number +92 61 6212543 and they said that we are giving you vivo 29 e free of cost board change. Now I am not satisfied with vivo mobile I&#039;m sorry, I don&#039;t want you guys to worry I don&#039;t want tampered mobile fixed, please refund my money
I don&#039;t want vivo mobile even for free I want my original price back because I don&#039;t trust vivo tamper mobile anymore Panchain my talk from Vivo Wale to refund my money You should repeat your role and do not treat anyone else like me
