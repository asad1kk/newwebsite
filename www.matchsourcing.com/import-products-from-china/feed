					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.matchsourcing.com/import-products-from-china#comment-46&quot;&gt;crys&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for your opinion based on a supplier&#039;s perspective. We agreed that pricing is basically in direct proportion to quality. Most Chinese manufacturers/suppliers are trustworthy. When doing business, either party tends to think in their own perspective. As our point of view, taking into consideration the other party&#039;s situation/idea would definitely promote the cooperation. Based on buyers/importers point of view, especially those who are not quite experienced in importing from China, it would help to present as many possibilities as possible(good/bad). Both parties would note possible issues that might happen during the whole import and export process. Knowing the problems that could happen would help to boost communication efficiency and protect both party benefits. 

Thanks again for your comment! It helps buyers and importers get to know more about what Chinese vendors are thinking. Appreciate it!]]></description>
